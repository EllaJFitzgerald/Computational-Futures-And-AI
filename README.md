## Introduction
This unit explores the emerging area of machine learning (ML) and its potential impact on culture and society. The unit is a mix of practical tasks introducing ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and seminars that look at emerging practice across the arts and creative industries that employ some level of artificial intelligence. This unit will also explore the centrality of ‘the network’ to computational experience and how machine learning is extending its scope and reach.

From this exploration we will use your new material understanding of machine learning methods and your developing critical framework to question cultural assumptions regarding artificial intelligence and to speculate in writing about emerging computational futures. This primary aim of this unit is to enable you to look past the hype of ‘AI’ and develop your critical framework for thinking about computational technology.

## Alex's thoughts
This module will be at the intersection of speculative design, experiential futures, interaction design, critical thinking & creative coding.

My goals for the course for you is:

+ To engage in critical creative practice with technology.
+ To be philosophers who don’t write down ideas, but instead make objects that embodied them.
+ To engage in rapid exploration and experimentation.
+ To explore futures and shape alternative futures that is different from the norm.

We will explore things with studio work and seminar-style discussion.

---

## Tangibles 
Throughout the module, our tangibles will include:

+ mockups 
+ videos 
+ prototypes  
+ design fictions 
+ interaction designs

---

## Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:

+ Understand how machine learning work in practice (Knowledge, Process)
+ Understand artificial Intelligence as a cultural concept (Enquiry)
+ Critically discuss computational futures (Enquiry, Communication)

## Unit Content & Assessment 

**Unit Assessment Summary -  This unit is assessed holistically**  
**Assignment Description**

+ You are asked to produce an essay of at least 2000 words that answers the supplied essay question (100%). (ESSAY QUESTION WILL BE SHARED IN COUPLE WEEKS)

---

### Class Rules:

+ To be human. 
+ There is no right or wrong.
+ We are here to learn and have fun.
+ Collaboration is everything. People are cool.
+ Respect everyone and their difference.
+ Give everyone a voice, recognize your privilege and be an ally.
+ Challenge each other in nice ways :) 


**Process Log:**

+ I would love for you to write your thoughts and learnings somewhere. I use medium but it could be github, wordpress blog, twitter, insta, are.na or what every butters your bread.
+ Write about the topics discussed in class, projects that inspire you, and the experimentations you will be doing.
+ This is your space to reflect and express yourself. It is your digital sketchbook. Decorate your blog however you choose, use an informal tone, scan your drawings, use memes --- so far as the content is intelligible, organised, and shows critical engagement with content of the module.

**Research Presentation Tips (from Irene Fubara-Manuel)**:

+ Contextualise the chosen subject, within the proper historical, political, cultural, and artistic environment.
+ Illustrate with videos, images, and text, the key pieces in the subject's portfolio.
+ Highlight the tools, processes and motivations of the subject.
+ Expand on how or why this topic speaks to you.
+ Bring 2-3 questions from your research that we can discuss in the seminar.
+ Submit your presentation as a PDF of your slides uploaded onto your GitHub repository.
